# Seasonal Lights

Miss the old Holiday Lights program? Can't get it to work on Windows 10 and later?

Seasonal Lights is a modern clone of Holiday Lights that works on newer versions of Windows.

This is very beta software at the moment, as I wanted to get this out in time for at least the Christmas Season.

## Features 

- Support for the Holiday Lights **.bul** format.
- Direct2D for fast and smooth bulb animations.
- Multi Monitor Support (Planned).
- APNG Support (Possibly)

## Features not included

I may, or may not add these at a future date, but alternatives exist if you really need these:

- Bulb Editor: To make new Bulbs you will have to use the original bulb editor included with Holiday Lights.
- Music Box: I personally recommend Winamp, which can even load DLS sound fonts if you want to get the old OPL feel again. Foobar2000 is also a decent option.
- Screen Saver: The old screen saver still works. I do not currently have plans to create one.
