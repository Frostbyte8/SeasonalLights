# Seasonal Lights

Miss the old Holiday Lights program? Can't get it to work on Windows 10 and later?

Seasonal Lights is a modern clone of Holiday Lights that works on newer versions of Windows.

**Note:** This is very beta software at the moment, as I wanted to get this out in time for at least the Christmas Season 2024. I will try to get this in full for next year! Check back in 2025.

## Current Features

- You can open a single **.bul** file. 
  - For now, you will just have to merge bulbs together to get multiple images. Sorry.
  - Remember, you can have up to 8 bulb images per side, that should hopefully help.
- Works only on your primary monitor.
- For now: Updates at 250ms.

## Eventual Features 

- Support for the Holiday Lights **.bul** format in full.
- A new **bulEx** format.
- Blink Modes (Implemented, but not selectable currently).
- Direct2D for fast and smooth bulb animations.
- Multi Monitor Support (Planned).
- APNG Support (Possibly).

## Features not included

I may, or may not add these at a future date, but alternatives exist if you really need these:

- Bulb Editor: To make new Bulbs you will have to use the original bulb editor included with Holiday Lights.
- Music Box: I personally recommend Winamp, which can even load DLS sound fonts if you want to get the old OPL feel again. Foobar2000 is also a decent option.
- Screen Saver: The old screen saver still works. I do not currently have plans to create one.
